            <h2 class="subheader">Forms</h2>
             <p>HTML forms are an important part of a website, because they provide a channel of communication between a user and the business. It’s also a good way to connect with users visiting your site as they could be potential customers or clients. Not only do forms help businesses communicate with users, they can help gather useful information on them like how many are visiting the website and how they came across it. A few things to consider while creating a form are the type of questions you may ask, and how they form is actually designed. These factors can determine whether or not the user will fill out the form or be deterred from doing so.</p>

            <p>In addition to allowing potential customers to communicate with businesses, web forms can help businesses collect data on website traffic. This valuable data can help businesses know their customer base better or help them see how well their marketing efforts are doing. According to Feedotter, “Most business owners have a general idea of who their target audience is, but by implementing forms on your website you can collect essential data to back up your assumptions. Forms are a great way to learn exactly who your audience is and what they’re interested in, which you can then use in reports or strategy meetings in the future” (Adisilvestro). Form fields asking questions about customer opinions or how customers found out about the business can help get a better understanding of who they are targeting and what kind of people their products are appealing to. In addition, paired with tools like Google Analytics, forms can allow you to keep track of website traffic, “In order to measure the effectiveness of your website, you need reliable metrics. Web forms give you just that. By setting up goals conversions from Google Analytics, you can track how many people visited your contact page and of those individuals, how many actually filled out the form” (Dumont).</p>
            
            <p>The best practices for forms are that they are accessible to the user, simple, and ask the right questions. If forms are not accessible and simple to the user, this can cause cause users to be steered away from filling out the form if it looks too complicated or can’t be accessible to them. Furthermore, a form that asks for irrelevant questions, may cause the user to not fill out the form. With this being said, it is crucial to make your form accessible such as offering different languages, “It is important that you consider the language you use for your web forms. Not everyone who is visiting your website might be comfortable with your primary language. Moreover, if your company seeks an international audience, you should take into account multiple languages (Bodony)”. It’s also important to consider the kinds of questions you ask on forms. Certain questions can cause users to abandon the form and create distrust between the business and the user. For example, phone numbers can be a sensitive question, “ClickTale ran a test and found they lost 39% of user sign-ups when they required a phone number. Asking for your visitors’ phone numbers can feel sketchy unless they know there’s a legitimate reason they’re being asked to provide that” (Verner).
